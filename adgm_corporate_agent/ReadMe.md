Automate **corporate document compliance checks** for **Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM)** regulations.  
This tool uses **rule-based validation + citation mapping** to detect missing documents, compliance violations, and jurisdiction errors.


##  Features

- ** Document Type Detection** â€“ Identifies corporate documents (AoA, MoA, Board Resolution, etc.) from `.docx` content.
- ** Process Recognition** â€“ Automatically detects if the uploaded files are for *Company Incorporation*.
- ** Compliance Verification** â€“ Checks against ADGM Companies Regulations 2020.
- ** Citations & Rule Mapping** â€“ Links each issue to its exact regulation excerpt.
- ** Inline Review Output** â€“ Option to insert comments/highlights into `.docx`.
- ** Structured JSON Reports** â€“ Generates compliance summaries for downstream processing.
